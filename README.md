## Observations-

* As a developer i found flutter to be very easy to get started and getting the job done.
* React and html web dev. background sure helped;
* A big mention to the ChakraUI framework as i found things very similar among them.
* Concept from React also behaves the same.
* At last Flutter has a sweet documentation which explains everything very clearly, also a big shout out to the fireship.io 12 minute flutter training video, a great resource.

## final note-
Looking forward to create some other useful tools with flutter, never the less one more tech added to the bucketðŸ˜‰.
